- Improve all pages appearence (make it look nicer, maybe some animations and etc...)
- start backend for excel sheet to aprrove / request and email
- directly email qr code instead of displaying it on success page to increase security
- Send calender invites (.cs files) with confirmation email
- Add autosave feature (in case they refresh mid-entry)
- Provide real-time validation (e.g. "Invalid ID format" as you type)
- Allow admin approval before sending tickets (status-based). [BACKEND]
- Use a secure backend to generate unique QR code tokens, not raw data.
- Set a date/time after which the submit button is disabled or hidden.

Done:
- Transition to new screen for successful submission
- Generate QR code to scan for ticket on success page
- Make qr code take you to another page where data is dsiplayed after inputting code
- move flags closer
- Include a "Contact Us" button and page for changes
- Make QR links expire after the event
- add time constraint to form (if possible) aka remove submit button
