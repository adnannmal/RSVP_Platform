To do:
- Find out if you can see different submissions instead of locally stored
- Remove locally stored data and qr code when backend starts
- Remove hardcoded PIN to ensure security so no one can get it through elements tab

BACKEND To do:
- Send calender invites (.cs files) with confirmation email
- Allow admin approval before sending tickets (status-based).
- Use a secure backend to generate unique QR code tokens, not raw data.
- Send calender invites (.cs files) with confirmation email
- directly email qr code instead of displaying it on success page to increase security
- check if email, and id have already been used  to prevent multiple submissions at once

- Generate QR code to scan for ticket on success page
- Make qr code take you to another page where data is dsiplayed after inputting code
- move flags closer
- Include a "Contact Us" button and page for changes
- Make QR links expire after the event
- add time constraint to form (if possible) aka remove submit button
- add countdown to inform users time left on form
- Locally store time of submission to add to logs (admin table)
- Fix table to keep logging submissions and not overwrite
- Add initial loading page for form to open
- Add clear entries to admin page
