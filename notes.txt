BACKEND To do:
- Send calender invites (.cs files) with confirmation email
- Allow admin approval before sending tickets (status-based).
- Use a secure backend to generate unique QR code tokens, not raw data.
- Send calender invites (.cs files) with confirmation email
- directly email qr code instead of displaying it on success page to increase security

- Make qr code take you to another page where data is dsiplayed after inputting code
- move flags closer
- Include a "Contact Us" button and page for changes
- Make QR links expire after the event
- add time constraint to form (if possible) aka remove submit button
- add countdown to inform users time left on form
